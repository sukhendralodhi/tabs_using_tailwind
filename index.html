          The Number.parseInt method parses a value as a string and returns
          the first integer. A radix parameter specifies the number system to
          use: 2 = binary, 8 = octal, 10 = decimal, 16 = hexadecimal. If radix
          is omitted, JavaScript assumes radix 10. If the value begins with
          "0x", JavaScript assumes radix 16.The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
          documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading
          Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
          multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
          its appearance.

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
          interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
          by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce
          content into the page. Other tags such as
        <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do
        not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
          written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS
          is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

          CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
          This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
          of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS
          in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the
          .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
          formatting.

          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
          styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
          screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
          content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

          The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than
          one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

          The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
          text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation
          service for CSS documents.[5]

          JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
          technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the
          client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

          JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10]
          It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
          supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
          interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
          Document Object Model (DOM).

          The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics
          facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

          JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and
          a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

          Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages
          are distinct and differ greatly in design.
